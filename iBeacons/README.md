# iBeacons

We have three bluetooth beacons from kontakt.io that can be used for your project. Ask anyone in the LiveHacks team to get them. The beacons are called Markus, Daniel and Magnus. 

## Where to start with the beacons
Documentation for the bluetooth beacons can be found here: https://developer.kontakt.io/rest-api/api-guides/quickstart/

## Example project
There is an example iOS project that is positioning the phone related to the position of the beacons. See *example-iBeacons* for the iOS project.
