## Alexa Skills

Alexa provides a set of built-in capabilities, referred to as _skills_. Alexa Skills Kit lets you teach Alexa _new skills_. 
You can build skills that provide users with many different types of abilities, such as look up answers to specific questions, challenge the user with games, control lights and IoT devices.

The first task for the developer, designer or thinker is to understand _what your skill will do_. Every skill has an _interaction model_ that determines the request the skill handle and the words users say to invoke those requests. You can define this yourself with a [_custom model_](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/ask-overviews/understanding-the-different-types-of-skills.html#custom-interaction-model) or with a [_pre-built model_](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/ask-overviews/understanding-the-different-types-of-skills.html#smart-home-skills-pre-built-model) in which the possible requests and utterances are pre-defined for you.  a list skill facilitates the use of list events in the skill service. Moreover it is important the concept of _list skills_, it facilitates the use of [list events](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/list-events-in-alexa-skills.html) in the skill service. Thus, the skills can understand and react to changes that happen to lists from top-level utterances on Alexa.
